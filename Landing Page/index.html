					<p>Dear reader,</p>
					<p>Have you ever suspected that Joe Biden's not <em>really</em> running America?</p>
					<p>Have you wondered who's <em>really</em> pulling the strings behind the scenes?</p>
					<p>Let me show you...</p>
					<p>I want you to take a close look at this man behind President Joe Biden...</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/001-biden.png" alt="001" /></figure>
					<p>He's been called "the most dangerous man in the world"...</p>
					<p>"The new Karl Marx"...</p>
					<p>And even "the Antichrist"...</p>
					<p>But I call him Joe Biden's Puppet Master...</p>
					<p>Because despite him never being elected to hold office and never being put up for a vote among "We the People..." </p>
					<p>I believe he's the man who's pulling <em>all</em> the strings...</p>
					<p>And directing <em>all</em> of Biden's policies that are destroying America.</p>
					<p>Every independent-thinking American deserves to know what this man is really up to...</p>
					<p>Because the next phase of his plan could take away your God-given freedoms and constitutional rights...</p>
					<p>Give the government complete control over your money...</p>
					<p>And <em>completely</em> destroy your way of life.<span>..</span></p>
					<p>As the <em>Hill</em> says:</p>
					<p class="testimonial"><strong><em>"If [this man and his team] are successful, life in America might never be the same."</em></strong></p>
					<p><span>As you're about to see, they could even lock you out of the financial system, including your own bank account. </span></p>
					<p>And no, I'm not talking about Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, George Soros, Bill Gates, or anyone you've likely heard of before...</p>
					<p>No.</p>
					<p>This man has <em>never</em> been on a ballot.</p>
					<p>He holds no <em>official</em> title.</p>
					<p>He's not part of any government committee, council, or cabinet.</p>
					<p>Instead, he's a Harvard-educated descendant of a Nazi family who operates <em>behind</em> the scenes.</p>
					<p>And you won't hear much about him from the corrupt mainstream media.</p>
					<p>So even though he's already having a direct impact on the lives of 335 million Americans...</p>
					<p>Most people have never heard of him.</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Operating In The Shadows</strong></h2>
					<p>In fact, my guess is that if he were standing right next to you in the grocery checkout line...</p>
					<p><span>Y</span>ou'd likely have no clue who he was.</p>
					<p>Worse yet, because he's not elected, you can't vote him out of power.</p>
					<p>Instead, he's the head of what many believe is the #1 anti-American organization in the world.</p>
					<p>He leads a small group of wealthy and powerful individuals who operate beyond national borders...</p>
					<p>Deciding policies they want to see applied on a global level...</p>
					<p>Policies that could enrich <em>them</em> and give them complete control over <em>your life</em>.</p>
					<p>In fact, he's connected to the world's most powerful men, including...</p>
					<p>Bill Gates...</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/002-Gates.png" alt="002" /></figure>
					<p>The Clinton family. Both Bill...</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/003-Clinton.png" alt="003" /></figure>
					<p>And Hillary...</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/004-Hillary.png" alt="004" /></figure>
					<p>The leader of the Chinese communist party, Xi Jinping...</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/005-Jiping.png" alt="005" /></figure>
					<p>And the head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, just to name a few...</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/006-Lagard.png" alt="006" /></figure>
					<p>He's also connected to some of the most powerful billionaires in the world, such as...</p>
					<p>Facebook's founder Mark Zukerberg...</p> 
					<p>Who controls much of what Americans see, read, and hear about on the internet...</p>
					<p>Amazon's founder and owner of the Washington Post Jeff Bezos...</p>
					<p>Who controls much of what Americans read about in the newspaper, and what they can and can't buy online...</p>
					<p>And George Soros, who's Hillary Clinton's most generous billionaire donor...</p>
					<p>And the biggest funder of the radical left and anti-American activities in the world.</p>
					<p>Biden's Puppet Master is connected to the heads of Big Pharma...</p>
					<p>Like the CEOs of the two big vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna...</p>
					<p>He's connected to the heads of major banking institutions, like the CEOs of Mastercard and Bank of America...</p>
					<p>And he's connected to the big players on Wall Street, like the CEO of Goldman Sachs...</p>
					<p>And the CEO of the world's largest asset manager BlackRock, Larry Fink...</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/007-Klaus-int+leaders.png" alt="007" /></figure>
					<p>I'm talking about the masters of the universe<span> who have the power to destroy your way of life.</span></p>
					<p>As dangerous as this is so far, it gets even worse...</p>
					<p>Because this man's most important connection <em>by far</em> is President Joe Biden.</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/009-Biden.png" alt="009" /></figure>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/10-Biden.png" alt="10" /></figure>
					<p>Today, through this very controversial video...</p>
					<p><strong>I'm going to prove to you how Biden and his Puppet Master <span>will </span>use a made-up climate crisis to give the global elite <em>complete control</em> of how you spend your money.</strong></p>
					<p>Very soon, they will get to decide what kind of car you're allowed to drive...</p>
					<p>What kind of food you're allowed to eat...</p>
					<p>What kind of books you're allowed to read...</p>
					<p>What you're able to put into your own body...</p>
					<p>What type of weapons you can and can't buy to protect your home...</p>
					<p>What kind of education your kids and grandkids are allowed to get...</p>
					<p>What kind of movies you're allowed to watch...</p>
					<p>And even how warm or cool you can keep your own home's thermostat...</p>
					<p>And I believe they're about to pull the trigger on the last phase of their evil plan.</p>
					<p>In fact, Reuters just broke the news that they're launching a pilot program to give them control over your money.</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/11-Banking+Giants.png" alt="11" /></figure>
					<p><span></span>So depending on when you're seeing this, you might have just a few days to prepare...</p>
					<p>Because once they flip the switch...</p>
					<p><span>I believe y</span>ou could lose access to your bank account, your credit card, and even your social security benefits.</p>
					<p>Look, I know this all sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory.</p>
					<p>But before you think I'm just some nut job wearing a tinfoil hat...</p>
					<p>You should know Bloomberg has ranked me as one of the top economists in America.</p>
					<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> even wrote an entire article about me, saying that my predictions were, and I quote, "knocking it out of the park."</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/12-The+Wall+Street+Journal.png" alt="12" /></figure>
					<p>That's why Bloomberg invites me to discuss the state of the economy on its TV show.</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/13-Bloomberg+tv+spot.png" alt="13" /></figure>
					<p>Trust me...</p>
					<p>I know that everything I said so far sounds extreme.</p>
					<p>But Biden's Puppet Master said it himself...</p>
					<p>In order to achieve his agenda...</p>
					<p class="testimonial"><strong><em>"No extreme scenario can now be taken off the table."</em></strong></p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>The Puppet Master's <br />"Extreme Measures"</strong></h2>
					<p>Think about that.</p>
					<p>Nothing is off the table.</p>
					<p>That's not me saying it.</p>
					<p>This is coming directly from Biden's Puppet Master.</p>
					<p>He's literally telling you that the end justifies all means.</p>
					<p>So if you have to lose your freedoms and your constitutional rights for them to enact their plan for global domination, <em>so be it.</em></p>
					<p>If you're locked out of your own bank account for them to force you to comply, <em>so be it.</em></p>
					<p>And if his plans end up ruining your financial future for their financial gain, <em>so be it.</em></p>
					<p>This man believes it's all for the greater good.<span>"</span></p>
					<p>And since he's connected to the most powerful people in the world...</p>
					<p>Shouldn't you believe his own words when he says that "no extreme scenario is off the table?"</p>
					<p>Shouldn't you at least take some measures today to protect yourself and your family from his devastatingly wealth-destroying ideas?</p>
					<p>That's why I'm here today.</p>
					<p>In the next few minutes I'm going to expose <em>everything. </em> </p>
					<p>I'm also going to give you my entire five-step blueprint on how to legally and ethically "opt out" of their plan.</p>
					<p>Because the reality is...</p>
					<p>I'm not even the only one who's figured this out.</p>
					<p>#1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author and renowned radio host Glenn Beck says:</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/14-Glenn+Beck.png" alt="14" /></figure>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>America Can't Be <em>That</em> Corrupt... <em>Right</em>? <br />Wrong.</strong></h2>
					<p>Look, I have to give you a heads up...</p>
					<p>Some of the stuff I'm going to show you today will shock you<span>...</span></p>
					<p>Just like it shocked me when I first discovered this.</p>
					<p>At first glance you won't want to believe what you hear today.</p>
					<p>You'll think, "There's no way our system can be that corrupt, not here in America."</p>
					<p>But you don't have to take my word for anything here.</p>
					<p>I've included all my sources in the Details and Disclosures link below this presentation...</p>
					<p>So, after this presentation ends<span>...</span></p>
					<p><span>Y</span>ou can click on this link and verify all the information for yourself.</p>
					<p>I'm also going to show you direct quotes from Joe Biden and his Puppet Master<span>...</span></p>
					<p><span>A</span>nd I'll let you be the judge if this is real or not.</p>
					<p>But if you still think this sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory, let me ask you this...</p>
					<p>If you wanted to intentionally destroy America, would you do anything differently than what President Biden is doing?</p>
					<p>Think about it...</p>
					<p>Instead of unleashing our very own domestic oil and gas production to ease pain at the pump for Americans...</p>
					<p>He has declared war on fossil fuels, all while draining our strategic oil reserve and begging dictators in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia for oil.</p>
					<p>He's devaluing the dollar at the fastest pace in 40 years...</p>
					<p>To a point where inflation is now forcing many families to choose between putting gas in their car or food on the table.</p>
					<p>401ks are getting wiped out...</p>
					<p>And mortgage rates are the highest in more than 20 years, putting home ownership out of reach for millions of Americans.</p>
					<p>He has opened the borders to about 5 million illegal immigrants...</p>
					<p>Including potential criminals, terrorists, welfare recipients, and enemies of the United States.</p>
					<p>He's also shrinking our Air Force, Navy, and Army...</p>
					<p>And turning our military into a bunch of woke wimps, all while driving us towards a potential war with another nuclear power.</p>
					<p>He's dividing the country by calling all of 75 million Americans who didn't vote for him "domestic terrorists"...</p>
					<p>And he's using race and gender to play us against each other.</p>
					<p>He's dumbing down and indoctrinating our children with anti-American propaganda in the schools and media.</p>
					<p>And he's emptying prisons and letting real criminals onto the streets...</p>
					<p>All while persecuting Americans who he considers to be his political opponents.</p>
					<p>Ask yourself...</p>
					<p>Can someone really be this <em>incompetent</em>?</p>
					<p>If you suspected there's something far more sinister going on, you're right.</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>USA: No Longer The <br />World's Superpower?</strong></h2>
					<p>In fact, Joe Biden's Puppet Master himself predicted that, and I quote...</p>
					<p>By 2030 "The U.S. will NOT be the world's leading superpower."</p>
					<p>And he's manipulating his puppet, President Biden, to make sure that prediction comes true.</p>
					<p>So in the next few minutes I'm going to prove to you that this is not just a matter of  incompetence.</p>
					<p>I'll show you how this is all part of a well-orchestrated plan to control not only your money...</p>
					<p>But what you think, where you go, what you say, what you eat, and what you wear...</p>
					<p>All while enriching a small group of unelected bureaucrats who are members of the global elite.</p>
					<p>I'm going to reveal who Biden's Puppet Master is...</p>
					<p>I'll pull off his mask and name his real name...</p>
					<p>And show you the smoking-gun proof that proves he's in control of the radical ideas coming out of the White House.</p>
					<p>More importantly, I'm going to show you the five steps you need to take to opt out of their evil plan.</p>
					<p>But before we get to all that, let me introduce myself.</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong><em>WSJ</em></strong><strong>: "Knocking it Out of The Park"</strong></h2>
					<p>My name, by the way, is Andrew Zatlin.</p>
					<p>I live in North Carolina with my wife and two kids.</p>
					<p>I've been a trained economist for more than 30 years...</p>
					<p>But I'm not just one of those academics who sits behind a desk writing boring papers all day, like most economists do.</p>
					<p>I spent two decades working in Silicon Valley...</p>
					<p>Where I held senior roles in Business Strategy and Operations at NEC Electronics and Cisco.</p>
					<p>That real-life experience gave me unique insights on how economies actually work and set me apart from other mainstream economists.</p>
					<p>That's why I was ranked #1 for Jobs Forecasting by Bloomberg<span><em>...</em></span></p>
					<p><span>A</span>head of analysts at major Wall Street firms like JP Morgan and Bank of America.</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/15-Bloomberg.png" alt="15" /></figure>
					<p>Today, I run an independent investment research firm called MoneyBall Economics<em>.</em></p>
					<p>By independent, I mean that I don't accept any advertisements from funds, companies, or think tanks.</p>
					<p>And that means I can't be compromised by money<span>...</span></p>
					<p><span>A</span>nd I can speak the truth without worry of being "<em>canceled</em>" by anyone.</p>
					<p>My research has been used by several of the world's top hedge funds that manage an excess of a combined $20 billion.</p>
					<p>And like I mentioned earlier...</p>
					<p>The<em> Wall Street Journal </em>reported that my economic predictions have "knocked it out of the park" when it comes to making money.</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/16-The+Wall+Street+Journal.png" alt="16" /></figure>
					<p>For example, while Joe Biden, his Treasury Secretary, and the Federal Reserve were all telling you that inflation would be transitory...</p>
					<p>I was warning my readers, saying that inflation was here to stay.</p>
					<p>Here's what I told my readers in late 2021:</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/17-Guru+quote.png" alt="17" /></figure>
					<p>I say this not to brag...</p>
					<p>But to show you that my predictions are based on what's actually happening in the economy.</p>
					<p>It's why Business Insider wrote that my work is based on "highly accurate, data-driven methods."</p>
					<p>And it's why even the left-wing newspaper the <em>Washington Post </em>admitted:</p>
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/18-Washington+Post_.png" alt="18" /></figure>
					<p>The bottom line is...</p>
					<p>My predictions are based on facts...</p>
					<p>And the facts here are crystal clear.</p>
					<p>With his Puppet Master pulling the strings...</p>
					<p>Joe Biden is planning to use a bogus global warming crisis to implement the most radical change in America's history.</p>
					<p>Let me show you how it's all playing out<span>...</span></p>
					<p><span>A</span>nd then, of course, I'll show you how to "opt out" of their plans to control you...</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Penetrating Governments <br />Around The World</strong></h2>
					<p>The first thing you should know is that this man runs a 3-year indoctrination program for global leaders...</p>
					<p>And he trains these future politicians to execute his plans.</p>
					<p>Just listen to his own words. He said:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/19-Klaus+Schwab.png" class="img-fluid" alt="" /></figure>
					<p>Again, those are his words.</p>
					<p>He blatantly stated that Angela Merkel of Germany<span>...</span></p>
					<p>Vladimir Putin of Russia, Justin Trudeau of Canada, and Emmanuel Macron of France were all "groomed" by him.</p>
					<p>That's how we end up with a lot of global leaders who follow similar policies that only benefit the global elite.</p>
					<p>And please, don't dismiss this message as me just being a shill for the Republican party.</p>
					<p>I'm not.</p>
					<p>Fact is, Biden's Puppet Master has buried himself deep inside the Republican establishment as well...</p>
					<p>He's influencing the right-leaning Governor of Maryland...</p>
					<p><span>T</span>he mayor of Miami... and multiple Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania, Mississippi, and, of course, California.</p>
					<p>Several members of Joe Biden's administration also went through his indoctrination program...</p>
					<p>Including the Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and the Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese.</p>
					<p>As Biden's Puppet Master likes to say...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/20-Klaus+Schwab.png" alt="20" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>And he couldn't have found a better puppet than Joe Biden.</p>
					<p>He's a lifelong politician.</p>
					<p>And it's proven that he'll read almost anything put in front of him on a teleprompter. </p>
					<p>Add in the fact that he's mentally impaired...</p>
					<p>And it makes him the perfect empty shell that the elites can use to implement their evil plan.</p>
					<p>In fact, these "global elites" have so little regard for us that they aren't even trying to hide the plans.</p>
					<p>They think so little of us that they aren't bothering to disguise their intentions.</p>
					<p>It's right in front of our faces.</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Directly From The Desk Of The <br />Puppet Master Right To <br />Biden's Teleprompter</strong></h2>
					<p>For example, look at Joe Biden's slogan, "Build back better."</p>
					<p>Do you think Joe Biden's campaign came up with that?</p>
					<p>No, they didn't.</p>
					<p>Biden and his team had more than a little help from his Puppet Master.</p>
					<p>Fact is, back in 2019, before Joe Biden's presidential campaign started<span>...</span></p>
					<p>Biden's Puppet Master was <em>already</em> using that phrase to indoctrinate several global leaders.</p>
					<p>In that year's official annual report from his organization, he wrote:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/21-World+Economic+Forum.png" alt="21" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>In mid-2020, his organization also published a paper saying...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/22-World+Economic+Forum.png" alt="22" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>A week later, Joe Biden published his economic plan on his campaign page...</p>
					<p>The name of his plan?</p>
					<p>You guessed it... "Build Back Better."</p>
					<p>That's how that became the official slogan of his campaign.</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/23-Biden+Harris.png" alt="23" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>It's clear the slogan came right from the lips of Biden's Puppet Master... directly to Biden's campaign site itself.</p>
					<p>That's called power <em>and</em> influence.</p>
					<p>Still think this is all a big coincidence?</p>
					<p>Shortly after Biden's election, someone asked John Kerry, the "climate czar," if Biden would help this man implement his evil plan.</p>
					<p>Listen to what he said:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/24-John+Kerry.png" alt="24" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Again, these are his words, not mine.</p>
					<p>This is coming directly from the same John Kerry who's met multiple times with Biden's Puppet Master.</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/25-John+Kerry.png" alt="25" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>And what they're planning is no small feat.</p>
					<p><strong>They just launched a pilot program that will ultimately give them the power to lock you out of the financial system, including your own bank account...</strong></p>
					<p>Without having to pass any new law by government dictate.</p>
					<p>That's why I'm urging you to prepare now with the five steps I'm going to cover here today.</p>
					<p>Now, these people may be evil...</p>
					<p>But they're not dumb.</p>
					<p>They know that such a radical plan is massive...</p>
					<p>And for them to be able to pull this off, they need to have a <em>big</em> crisis.</p>
					<p>Like Obama's former chief of staff Rahm Emmanuel once said:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/26-Rahm+Emmanuel_.png" alt="26" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p><span>So when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world in 2020...</span></p>
					<p>It gave them the perfect opportunity to implement their plan and expand their control.</p>
					<p>Again, if you think that I'm just making this stuff up...</p>
					<p>Just listen to what Biden's Puppet Master said in mid-2020.</p>
					<p>He said that all the lockdowns and mandates across the globe...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/28-Klaus+Schwab.png" alt="28" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>So he clearly admitted they were planning to use the pandemic to implement their plan.</p>
					<p>But it didn't work because the pandemic was temporary.</p>
					<p>To achieve their goal of completely changing every aspect of society and taking control of your money...</p>
					<p>They need a more dangerous crisis to "solve"...</p>
					<p>One that's permanent and not going to go away anytime soon...</p>
					<p>And one that could supposedly destroy all human life on earth.</p>
					<p>Does anything come to mind?</p>
					<p>Can you think of anything you've heard from Biden and the corrupt mainstream media lately?</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>The Government Never Lets a Good<br />Crisis Go To Waste... Even If They Have<br />To Make The Crisis Up</strong></h2>
					<p>Yes, I'm talking about climate change.</p>
					<p>They're doing everything they can to convince you that global warming is an imminent and existential crisis.</p>
					<p>That's why Biden's Puppet Master started a propaganda campaign to promote the idea that climate change will be much worse than any pandemic.</p>
					<p>He said:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/29-Klaus+Schwab.png" alt="29" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Shortly after, Joe Biden, playing his part as the perfect puppet, said this:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/30-Joe+Biden.png" alt="30" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>The only problem is that this is just another one of Joe Biden's countless blunders...</p>
					<p>Just like when he said inflation would be transitory... or the border is secure... or that "our economy is strong as hell."</p>
					<p>The idea that the human race is about to be extinct because of climate change is, as Joe Biden likes to say, malarkey.</p>
					<p>And that's not just me saying it...</p>
					<p>Check out this headline...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/31-Epoch+times.png" alt="31" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>He says there's <em>no</em> climate emergency.</p>
					<p>This isn't coming from a nut job.</p>
					<p>It's coming from the founder of the world's largest environmental activist organization...</p>
					<p>It's coming from a man regarded as one of the world's most qualified experts on the environment.</p>
					<p>When asked why he left Greenpeace, he said:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/32-Patrick+Moore.png" alt="32" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>And, again, I don't want you to take my word for it because I'm not a climate scientist.</p>
					<p>Instead, I want you to listen to the one scientist who literally wrote the book on it...</p>
					<p>A book called <em>Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn't, and Why It Matters</em>.</p>
					<p>His name is Steve Koonin. And he's not just some crazy conspiracy theorist.</p>
					<p>He has an MIT doctorate in physics.</p>
					<p>And he's the former chief scientist for BP and former Undersecretary for Science at the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>
					<p>After analyzing all the available science, he called all this climate alarmism "hubris."</p>
					<p>Yes, it's true that the globe is warming modestly.</p>
					<p>But it has been warming since about the year 1700.</p>
					<p>For context, that was 150 years <em>before</em> we were using fossil fuels.</p>
					<p>And yes, it's true that humans are having some type of influence.</p>
					<p>But the why and how aren't as clear as they want you to believe.</p>
					<p>And the idea that we're all going to die is complete BS.</p>
					<p>Listen to his conclusion:</p>
					<p><em>"Very few people, and that includes journalists who report on climate news, read the actual science. I have.</em></p>
					<p><em>And what the data&#8212;the hard science&#8212;says is that... things are NOT that bad.</em></p>
					<p><em>Heat waves in the US are NO MORE COMMON than they were in 1900.</em></p>
					<p><em>Hurricane activity is NO DIFFERENT that it was a century ago.</em></p>
					<p><em>Floods have NOT increased across the globe over more than seventy years.</em></p>
					<p><em>Greenland's ice sheet is NOT shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago.</em></p>
					<p>And the temperature extremes in the U.S. have become LESS COMMON and somewhat MILDER since the late nineteenth century.</p>
					<p>Look, I care about our environment...</p>
					<p>But does that sound to you like we're really facing the end of the world?</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, most people don't know the truth because Biden's Puppet Master and his associates have corrupted scientists...</p>
					<p>And they've launched a censorship campaign to bury the truth.</p>
					<p>Anyone who goes against their narrative is immediately labeled as a "climate denier."</p>
					<p>Facebook even suppressed a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> review of the book I just mentioned, <em>Unsettled</em>. "</p>
					<p>The <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Washington Post</em> never even reviewed the book.</p>
					<p>Working with the corrupt mainstream media...</p>
					<p>Biden's Puppet Master and his "elites" have also launched a very successful propaganda campaign to scare the bejesus out of everyone.</p>
					<p>It's a fear-mongering campaign designed to give them the perfect excuse to implement their evil plan...</p>
					<p>And take control of your money and your life.</p>
					<p>Again, that's not just me saying it.</p>
					<p>For example, the Associated Press confessed that last year they received $8 million just to promote claims of global warming.</p>
					<p>That's why you see headlines like this one from <em>The Guardian</em>...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/34-The+Guardian.png" alt="34" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Or this one from CNN, claiming that we only have until 2030 to save the world...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/35-CNN.png" alt="35" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>They've even turned daily weather forecasts into a propaganda machine.</p>
					<p>Take a look at this example...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/36-Map.png" alt="36" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>If you look at the temperatures and compare them to 10 years ago, they actually went DOWN.</p>
					<p>But in order to create the illusion that we're all going to burn to death soon, they're now showing the entire map covered in red.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, all this propaganda is working.</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Using Fear To Control <br />The Population</strong></h2>
					<p>More than half of the U.S. population now believes that it is likely that entire cities will be lost to rising sea levels.</p>
					<p>If that's true, why did Obama buy a $15 million oceanfront mega-mansion in Martha's Vineyard?</p>
					<p>If he were <em>really</em> concerned about rising sea levels, wouldn't he avoid all oceanfront property for fear of death and destruction?</p>
					<p>My guess is that Obama knows it's all a made-up crisis.</p>
					<p>What's even more insane is that just over one-third of Americans believe climate change will lead to Earth becoming uninhabitable for all life.</p>
					<p>In other words, one-third of Americans believe we're all going to die because of global warming.</p>
					<p>Like I said, the propaganda from Biden's Puppet Master and his cronies have brainwashed millions of Americans.</p>
					<p>The reality is that this climate hysteria has been going on for decades...</p>
					<p>In the 1970s, they predicted that today we would be facing, and I quote,</p>
					<p>"a disastrous new ice age."</p>
					<p>That's right.</p>
					<p>Instead of global warming, they were predicting we were all going to freeze to death in a global <em>cooling</em>.</p>
					<p>It didn't happen.</p>
					<p>In the 1980s, they said "entire nations could be wiped off of the face of the earth by rising sea levels by 2000."</p>
					<p>It didn't happen.</p>
					<p>In 2008, former presidential candidate Al Gore, who you see here with Biden's Puppet Master, predicted the North Polar Ice Cap would be completely ice free in five years.</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/37-Gore.png" alt="37" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>John Kerry, who flies around the world in his private jet polluting the earth more that you and I ever will, made the same prediction.</p>
					<p>But guess what?</p>
					<p>It's been 15 years since Gore made the claim.</p>
					<p>Far as I can see, the Polar Ice Cap is still just that – an ice cap.</p>
					<p>And snow cover across the Northern Hemisphere actually just reached the <em>highest</em> level since measurements began in 1967.</p>
					<p>Or look at the new monarch of Britain, King Charles III, who you see here meeting with Biden's Puppet Master.</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/38-King+Charles.png" alt="38" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>In 2009, he said we only had about 8 years to save the world.</p>
					<p>14 years later, we're all still here.</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>An Unblemished Track Record <br />of Being <em>Dead Wrong</em></strong></h2>
					<p>For more than 50 years, these climate alarmists have been predicting that some terrible environmental catastrophe was imminent.</p>
					<p>I found 51 predictions in total.</p>
					<p>And they have a perfect record of getting all 51 predictions wrong...</p>
					<p>None of their predictions came true. Not even once.</p>
					<p>Now let me be clear – it's fair and right to be concerned about the environment overall.</p>
					<p>But the climate change talk is all about whipping up <em>hysteria</em>.</p>
					<p>Fact is, they'll create extreme positions and outcomes... and tell us the world is likely to end unless we take action. Extreme action.</p>
					<p>And that's the point, isn't it? They want us to take <em>their</em> action. They want us to swallow <em>their</em> solutions.</p>
					<p>And the question we must ask is – <em>for what end</em>?</p>
					<p>Facing certain gloom, they tell us the only way to solve this crisis is to give them absolute power and control.</p>
					<p>And that's their endgame – power and control.</p>
					<p>The bad news is...</p>
					<p>According to consulting firm KPMG, 96% of the 250 largest companies in the world are <em>already</em> behind this green energy nonsense.</p>
					<p>Why?</p>
					<p>One word...</p>
					<p>Money.</p>
					<p>Think about it...</p>
					<p>A transition to green energy would demand trillions and trillions of dollars...</p>
					<p>Huge new public work policy... and <em>massive</em> government funding.</p>
					<p>If you want a crisis that guarantees governments gain more power...</p>
					<p>And that allows them to steal more of your money for their plans, funneled into their investments and their family and friends...</p>
					<p>This false climate crisis is it.</p>
					<p>Again, that's not just me saying it.</p>
					<p>John Kerry said recently:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/40-John+Kerry.png" alt="40" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>An International Energy Agency report put out last year found that to reach net zero by mid-century...</p>
					<p>The world will need to ramp clean energy spending up to more than $4 trillion annually by 2030.</p>
					<p>$4 trillion... every year.</p>
					<p>Where do you think that money is going to flow to?</p>
					<p>I can tell you it's not going to go to your pocket or mine.</p>
					<p>It's going to go to all their cronies, lining the pockets of all those people who are part of this plan.</p>
					<p>That's why Biden's Puppet Master has already struck deals with major corporations such as Amazon, Apple, Bank of America, Boeing, and many others.</p>
					<p>And they've all pledged to <em>force</em> a demand for "green" products.</p>
					<p>With central bankers, billionaires, major corporations, the media, members of Congress, the White House...</p>
					<p>And pretty much all of the most powerful people in the entire world all behind this plan...</p>
					<p><br />There's no way to stop it.</p>
					<p>And very soon, I believe their crazy climate conspiracies will go from corporations... directly to you and me.</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Big Brother Is Coming...</strong></h2>
					<p>Soon they will start tracking our <em>individual</em> carbon footprints.</p>
					<p>Biden's Puppet Master is already working with corporations like the Chinese company Alibaba to make sure that happens.</p>
					<p>Don't believe me. Listen for yourself...</p>
					<p>Once they track your individual carbon footprint...</p>
					<p>They'll be able to track where you travel. What you eat. And how you live.</p>
					<p>Pretty scary, right?</p>
					<p>Biden's Puppet Master even launched an initiative called "My Carbon," defending the idea that we should track everyone's carbon footprint.</p>
					<p>Why would they want to track your carbon footprint?</p>
					<p>I believe they want each of us to have a personal carbon allowance.</p>
					<p>And again, that's not just me saying it.</p>
					<p>As a recent <em>Nature</em> journal piece notes, COVID-19 lockdowns have prepared people for "personal carbon allowances."</p>
					<p>The piece wrote that restrictions on individual freedoms "that were unthinkable only one year before" have us "more prepared to accept the tracking and limitations" to "achieve a safer climate."</p>
					<p>Their propaganda machine is already working to normalize this idea.</p>
					<p>And they're already starting to implement it.</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/42-tear+quote.png" alt="42" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/43-Gore.png" alt="43" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Former Vice President Al Gore has partnered with Google to use satellite technology to track "individual emitters" of greenhouse gasses around the world.</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Tracking = Controlling</strong></h2>
					<p>Listen closely, because here's the crux of everything I'm warning you about today:</p>
					<p>Once a government is able to track you, they're able to <em>control</em> you.</p>
					<p>If they think you're using up too much oil and gas to heat your home... they'll simply turn down your thermostat.</p>
					<p>They'll be able to <em>control</em> you.</p>
					<p>If they think you're eating too much red meat, fed by cows who emit carbon...</p>
					<p>They'll only allow you to eat that awful "meatless meat" they're selling in stores now. If you don't comply... they'll <em>force</em> you to comply.</p>
					<p>They'll be able to <em>control</em> you.</p>
					<p>Remember, power and control are what they're really after.</p>
					<p>Once the individual carbon footprint is in place, the only thing missing will be a compliance mechanism.</p>
					<p>Something that <em>forces</em> you to comply.</p>
					<p>And that's what really keeps me up at night.</p>
					<p>Pay close attention to what I'm about to say, because almost no one else is telling you about what's coming and how to prepare.</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Programmable Money Is Coming To<br />Your Bank Account Soon</strong></h2>
					<p>I believe they're going to enforce your personal "carbon allowance" by introducing a new type of U.S. dollar...</p>
					<p>A digital dollar that would give them complete control of your money.</p>
					<p>Unlike the current dollar, this new digital dollar would not exist in physical form.</p>
					<p>You wouldn't be able to go to a bank or ATM and withdraw it.</p>
					<p>It's a digital currency, but it's very different from bitcoin.</p>
					<p>Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin operate on blockchain technology, which is <em>decentralized</em> by design.</p>
					<p>Digital U.S. dollars, on the other hand, would be <em>centralized</em>, completely traceable and programmable by the Puppet Masters.</p>
					<p>In late 2021, Biden's Puppet Master announced a plan to work with the U.S. government and corporations to develop a digital dollar.</p>
					<p>At that time, he said:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/44-Klaus+Schwab.png" alt="44" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Of course, shortly after the Puppet Master made that statement, the Federal Reserve released a paper saying:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/45-Klaus+Schwab.png" alt="45" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Once again, straight from the Puppet Master's mouth to U.S. policy.</p>
					<p>Is this just a coincidence?</p>
					<p>Then a few months later, President Biden signed an executive order that said, and I quote...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/46-Biden.png" alt="46" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Now, you don't have to believe a single word of what I'm saying.</p>
					<p>You can read his executive order for yourself. It says in plain English that...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/47-Exec+order.png" alt="47" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>So the White House is telling us exactly how they're planning to use this digital dollar.</p>
					<p>And once you combine this carbon tracking ability with a digital dollar...</p>
					<p>Then it's game over.</p>
					<p><span>If you don't take the five steps I'm recommending here today... </span></p>
					<p>They will have complete control over your life.</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>The Plan For <br /><em><u>Complete</u></em> Control</strong></h2>
					<p>Imagine the following scenario...</p>
					<p>Let's say you want to fly to visit your kids and grandkids to spend thanksgiving together.</p>
					<p>With a digital dollar, they will be able to ban you from buying tickets if you're considered a "big polluter."</p>
					<p>Sorry.</p>
					<p>But you're not allowed to buy tickets because you already flew too many times this year, and you've met your personal carbon allowance limit.</p>
					<p>This would happen automatically because the digital dollar would be coded to "stop working" for certain purchases under certain circumstances.</p>
					<p>For example, if you go over your personal carbon allowance<span>...</span></p>
					<p>They could even impose fees and punish you by withdrawing money directly from your account.</p>
					<p>Biden's Puppet Master said it himself.</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/48-Klaus+schwab.png" alt="48" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Again, those are his words, not mine.</p>
					<p>He's already working with big banks to make sure nobody who's considered a polluter can get a loan.</p>
					<p>The banks involved?</p>
					<p>Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup.</p>
					<p>They're all already planning to include energy ratings in their mortgage decisions.</p>
					<p>Or look at gas-powered cars.</p>
					<p>Biden's administration already declared they want to ban them.</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/49-administration.png" alt="49" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>His Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said that "we've got to make sure that this happens quickly enough to beat climate change."</p>
					<p>Soon, once they're able to track your "personal carbon footprint<span>...</span>"</p>
					<p>They could make your "digital dollars" stop working at the gas pump once you've purchased a certain amount of gasoline in a week.</p>
					<p>Or they could ban your car outright, so you wouldn't be able to put gas in your car...</p>
					<p>Or even purchase a gas-powered vehicle.</p>
					<p>In other words, they'd have complete control over what kind of car you're allowed to drive.</p>
					<p>They could also decide what kind of food you're allowed to eat.</p>
					<p>For example, if you go to the website of Biden's Puppet Master, you'll find an article that says that...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/50-quote.png" alt="50" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>In other words, the Puppet Master believes meat is bad for the environment.</p>
					<p>With the digital dollar, they would be able to easily ban or limit your purchase of red meat... all for "the greater good."</p>
					<p>Biden's Puppet Master's organization even issued this prediction:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/51-quote.png" alt="51" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Perhaps, that's why they're trying to normalize the idea of eating bugs.</p>
					<p>It's so strange that you can't make this stuff up. Check out this tweet, directly from his organization:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/52-Tweet.png" alt="52" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Instead of burgers, they want you to eat crickets. I'm not kidding.</p>
					<p>His minions in the mainstream media are also getting behind this propaganda...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/53-CNN.png" alt="53" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>With CNN predicting:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/54-CNN.png" alt="54" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Sounds delicious, right?</p>
					<p>If all this sounds extreme to you, let me remind you again that Biden's Puppet Master said...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/55-Klaus+Schwab.png" alt="55" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Already in California and New York<span>...</span></p>
					<p><span>G</span>overnment officials are doing all types of silly things, like threatening to ban gas stoves, to save the environment.</p>
					<p>In fact, this goes well beyond just climate change...</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Your Freedoms Could Soon <br />Be "Turned Off"</strong></h2>
					<p>Once they flip the switch on the digital dollar, they could control <em>every</em> aspect of your life.</p>
					<p>Let's say for example you want to buy a pillow from the founder of MyPillow and Trump supporter Mike Lindell.</p>
					<p class="text-indent"><em>Sorry, you can't get a good night's sleep because he's considered part of the dangerous MAGA movement.</em></p>
					<p>Not updated on your tenth COVID booster shot?</p>
					<p class="text-indent"><em>Sorry, your digital dollars won't work anywhere until you get that shot.</em></p>
					<p>Want to donate money to your church?</p>
					<p class="text-indent"><em>Sorry, you're not allowed because your church doesn't support the right to "choose" an abortion.</em></p>
					<p>Want to support a politician?</p>
					<p class="text-indent"><em>Only if you're donating to candidates in the Puppet Master's preferred "party."</em></p>
					<p>Trying to buy any book that criticizes the government?</p>
					<p class="text-indent"><em>Sorry, you're not allowed because that book is full of "dangerous misinformation" that doesn't support their narratives.</em></p>
					<p>Did you say anything on social media that goes against their narrative?</p>
					<p class="text-indent"><em>They could label you as a spreader of misinformation and completely cut off your access to your own bank account until you delete your social media post.</em></p>
					<p>Are you considered "the wrong race" and making more money than the average American?</p>
					<p class="text-indent"><em>They could say you have "white privilege" and automatically withdraw money from your account to fund a "universal basic income" program.</em></p>
					<p>With the digital dollar, Biden would also finally be able to ban assault weapons, like he's been promising.</p>
					<p>And he'd be able to do it without having to pass a single new law.</p>
					<p>Once a "digital dollar" is here, they could easily program the digital dollar to "stop working" for certain guns or ammunition.</p>
					<p>The opportunities for them are limitless, and frankly... terrifying.</p>
					<p>So just ask yourself...</p>
					<p>Do you think President Biden and his puppet master would like to have that kind of power over you?</p>
					<p>And do you <em>want</em> a team like Joe Biden's to have their hand on the levers of this power?</p>
					<p>And here's the really scary part: A digital dollar isn't some far off event.</p>
					<p>You don't have a decade to prepare. The infrastructure for their "programmable money" is <em>already</em> being built...</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Not Some Far-Off, Distant Event</strong></h2>
					<p>And like I mentioned before, they just launched a pilot program.</p>
					<p>Our central bank, the Federal Reserve, just announced a 12-week digital dollar pilot with a few global banking giants...</p>
					<p>Like Citigroup, HSBC, Mastercard and Wells Fargo.</p>
					<p>You're looking at the press release on your screen...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/56-press+release.png" alt="56" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>So let me repeat that...</p>
					<p>This is a pilot program to implement the digital dollar.</p>
					<p>Do you know what that means?</p>
					<p>I believe it means this is the last phase before the official launch.</p>
					<p>That's why The Hill wrote:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/57-The+HIll.png" alt="57" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>I believe they're going to roll it out across the nation soon after the pilot program concludes.</p>
					<p>Just listen to what Citigroup executive Tony McLaughlin said:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/58-Tony+McLaughlin.png" alt="58" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>He's essentially saying he wants to expand this to include your bank deposit...</p>
					<p>Your checking and savings accounts.</p>
					<p>And let me remind you that Bank of America, Chase, Citi Group, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo have all already partnered with Joe Biden's Puppet Master.</p>
					<p>These are the six largest banks in America.</p>
					<p>So there's already a very good chance you're banking with one of them.</p>
					<p>The CEO of Wells Fargo even said that:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/59-The+CEO+of+Wells+Fargo_.png" alt="59" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>The CEOs of Bank of America and CitiGroup said the same... that climate change will influence every banking decision, including loans.</p>
					<p>Mastercard, Visa and Paypal are also on board.</p>
					<p>Are you paying attention yet?</p>
					<p>Those are basically all the companies that run our entire financial system.</p>
					<p>After everything I showed you today, if you still think none of this is a problem...</p>
					<p>I don't know what else to tell you.</p>
					<p>Why would they launch a pilot program with all these banks if they were not planning to roll it out?</p>
					<p>That's why I urge you to act now to protect yourself and your family.</p>
					<p>So let me show you how you can opt out of their evil plan.</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Get Out of Cash <em>Right Now</em></strong></h2>
					<p>There's basically five steps I recommend you take immediately...</p>
					<p>You see, we're up against some very powerful forces. To beat them, we need to consider both an offensive and defensive strategy.</p>
					<p>You need to have a defensive strategy that will help you protect your assets and make sure they cannot take control of your money.</p>
					<p>But you also need to have an offensive strategy that will help you grow your wealth during this difficult time.</p>
					<p>So let me cover the defensive strategies first...</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Step #1: Opt Out of the <br />Digital Dollar</strong></h2>
					<p>Like I showed you today, once the digital dollar is live...</p>
					<p>Biden's administration could lock you out of your banking account.</p>
					<p>Remember, Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau was groomed by Biden's Puppet Master...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/60-Truedeu.png" alt="60" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>And when truckers started to protest vaccine mandates, what did he do?</p>
					<p>He declared an emergency and used terrorism laws to seize the bank accounts of the truckers and anyone who was donating money to them.</p>
					<p>According to the Daily Mail, it was Joe Biden who pressured the Canadian Prime minister to take just drastic measures.</p>
					<p>Biden already called everyone who didn't vote for him "domestic terrorists."</p>
					<p>Once the digital dollar is live, do you think he would think twice before freezing your account?</p>
					<p>That's why former PayPal executive David Sacks said:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/61-David+Sacks.png" alt="61" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Like I showed you here today, I believe they'll use this bogus climate crisis as their emergency.</p>
					<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has already been pressuring Joe Biden to declare a climate emergency.</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/62-Senate.png" alt="62" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>He said: "President Biden can do many, many things under the emergency powers ... that he could do without legislation."</p>
					<p>Once the digital dollar pilot program is over ...</p>
					<p>I wouldn't be surprised if the very next day President Biden goes on national TV and declares a national climate emergency...</p>
					<p>And officially announces the roll out of the digital dollar, along with personal carbon allowances.</p>
					<p>That's why you need to opt out of the digital dollar <em>right now</em>.</p>
					<p>Now, I can't give you all the instructions on how to do that in this video...</p>
					<p>Because if they hear about it, they could shut this page down or even close all those "loopholes" I'm recommending.</p>
					<p>So here's what I did...</p>
					<p>I put all the instructions you need to follow inside a special report called <strong>How to Opt Out of the Digital Dollar.</strong></p>
					<figure class="bonus-reports" style="margin-bottom: 1.4rem;"><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/62_A-How+to+Opt+Out+of+the+Digital+Dollar.png" alt="62_A" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>And don't worry.</p>
					<p>This has nothing to do with getting a second passport... or moving out of the country or opening off-shore accounts.</p>
					<p>Instead, it's a simple set of instructions that anyone can follow to basically take your assets "off the grid."</p>
					<p>That way, Biden and his Puppet Master will never be able to touch them.</p>
					<p>Inside this report, I will tell you about...</p>
					<p class="text-indent"><strong>*** What might just be the only asset you do NOT have to report to the U.S. government.</strong> Leaked documents show that celebrities, politicians, oligarchs and other members of the uber-rich are all moving billions of dollars into this.</p>
					<p class="text-indent"><strong>*** A little-known asset that has beaten stocks, real estate and gold over the last 25 years... and it's 100% protected from the digital dollar.</strong></p>
					<p class="text-indent"><strong>***A recession-proof investment that Biden and his Puppet Master won't be able to touch.</strong> I will give you a hint... it fits in your pocket and you'll never have to report it to the IRS.</p>
					<p>And much, much more.</p>
					<p>I'll show you how you can get immediate access to this report in just a moment.</p>
					<p>All you have to do is say "yes", and I'll give you this report.</p>
					<p>But before I show you how to claim this report, let me show you another <em>defensive</em> step I'm recommending...</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Step #2: Move Some of Your Cash Into<br />the Puppet Master Protection Portfolio </strong><strong> </strong></h2>
					<p>Ever since Biden moved into the White House, we've seen a complete bloodbath in the markets.</p>
					<p>In 2022, stocks, bonds, cryptos... everything crashed.</p>
					<p>Given all of Biden's destructive policies, I expect the markets to remain volatile in the coming weeks and months...</p>
					<p>Which is why I just build this all-weather portfolio that should perform well, no matter what happens in the market.</p>
					<p>For example, it includes an investment outside the stock market that has been called "the recession-proof trade of 2023..."</p>
					<p>And a stock market play that actually went UP last year... one that I expect to beat the market again this year.</p>
					<p>You'll find all the details of this model portfolio inside another special report called <strong>The Puppet Master Protection Portfolio.</strong></p>
					<figure class="bonus-reports" style="margin-bottom: 1.4rem;"><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/63_A-The+Puppet+Master+Protection+Portfolio.png" alt="63_A" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>I'll tell you how to claim this report in just a moment.</p>
					<p>But I'm also recommending a few steps that will not only protect your wealth, but help you grow it.</p>
					<p>And that brings me to the next move...</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Step #3: Invest in the "1,000% Backdoor" <br />Play Into the Digital Dollar </strong></h2>
					<p>As I mentioned before, the infrastructure for the digital dollar has already been built.</p>
					<p>And I found a unique way for you to actually <em>invest</em> in it.</p>
					<p>I mean, if Biden is going to implement this radical change to the U.S. dollar, you might as well profit from it, right?</p>
					<p>Some of the smartest investors in the world are already starting to make this same move I'm recommending.</p>
					<p class="text-indent"><em>I'm talking about people like Elon Musk...</em></p>
					<p class="text-indent"><em>Billionaire and Shark Tank star Marc Cuban...</em></p>
					<p class="text-indent"><em>And billionaire and legendary investor Carl Icahn, who's planning to move as much as $1.5 billion away from the traditional banks and into what I'm recommending.</em></p>
					<p>I believe they're moving their money because they know this radical change is happening at lightning fast speed.</p>
					<p>There's no time to waste.</p>
					<p>That's why I put all the details inside another special report called <strong>The "1,000% Backdoor" Play Into the Digital Dollar.</strong></p>
					<figure class="bonus-reports" style="margin-bottom: 1.4rem;"><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/64_A-The+1000+Backdoor+Play+Into+the+Digital+Dollar.png" alt="64_A" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>There's more...</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Step #4: Invest in the Only Booming<br /> Sector of the Economy  </strong><strong> </strong></h2>
					<p>Like I showed you here today, Biden's green energy policy is designed to enrich a small group of unelected bureaucrats<span>...</span></p>
					<p>All while impoverishing the middle class.</p>
					<p>Biden can blame the higher price of oil on Putin all day long and call it "Putin's price hike."</p>
					<p>But nobody is buying it.</p>
					<p>Everyone with a brain knows that his own war on fossil fuels is the main reason why the price of oil has skyrocketed.</p>
					<p>During his campaign, he promised he would end fossil fuel.</p>
					<p>And he's trying to keep that promise. He even promised more recently "no more drilling."</p>
					<p>He wants to replace fossil fuel with "renewable" energy sources like wind and solar.</p>
					<p>And look, I wish we could power the U.S. and the entire world with just wind and solar energy.</p>
					<p>But that's a pipe dream.</p>
					<p>As the founder of Greenpeace Patrick Moore says...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/65-Patrick+Moore_.png" alt="65" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Anyone who's not bought and paid for understands this administration's green energy policy makes absolutely no sense.</p>
					<p>Even Elon Musk said:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/66-Elon+Musk.png" alt="66" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>This is coming from the guy who sells more electric vehicles than anyone else.</p>
					<p>But believe it or not, this is all part of their plan to keep the price of oil as high as possible.</p>
					<p>You see, the higher the price of oil, the better for them because they can use that as a reason to accelerate the transition.</p>
					<p>As an associate of Biden's Puppet Master said:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/67-quote.png" alt="67" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Like I said, they want to keep the price of oil as high as possible.</p>
					<p>That's why I don't expect the price of oil to come down anytime soon.</p>
					<p>And while that's bad news for you every time you go to the gas station...</p>
					<p>Biden's crazy green energy policy is actually triggering a huge boom in oil stocks.</p>
					<p>For example, look at shares of Occidental Petroleum Corporation.</p>
					<p>Despite all the market chaos we saw in 2022, you could have more than doubled your money with this oil stock.</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/68-OXY.png" alt="68" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Or look at the petroleum refinery PBF Energy. It went even higher... and it's up 230%.</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/69-PBF.png" alt="69 - PBF" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>And the tanker shipping company Scorpio tankers skyrocketed as high as 340%.</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/69-STNG.png" alt="69 - STNG" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Think about that.</p>
					<p>This all happened in 2022, a year when stocks, bonds, cryptos and pretty much everything you can think of crashed.</p>
					<p>That's why Warren Buffett is going all in. He just invested $60 billion in this sector.</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/71-Buffet.png" alt="71" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>And this boom is likely to continue in 2023.</p>
					<p>As Yahoo finance says:</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/72-Yahoo.png" alt="72" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>That's why I just put together another bonus report called <strong>My #1 Energy Play for 2023.</strong></p>
					<figure class="bonus-reports" style="margin-bottom: 1.4rem;"><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/73_A-My+1+Energy+Play+for+2023.png" alt="73_A" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>It includes the name, ticker symbol and full analysis on a play that I believe could make you a lot of money in the coming months. </p>
					<p>If you lost money in 2022, this could be your chance to recoup some or even all of your losses.</p>
					<p>I'll tell you how to claim this report in just a moment. First, let's cover the fifth, and final, move you should make right now...</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Step #5: Buy Into The Perfect Inflation <br />Hedge Right Now</strong></h2>
					<p>Biden's green energy policy is a big reason why we're seeing the highest inflation in the last 40 years.</p>
					<p>That's because when the price of oil increases, it has a snowball effect on everything.</p>
					<p>For example, transportation of any product becomes more expensive.</p>
					<p>And companies pass that higher cost on to you.</p>
					<p>Also, hundreds of products are derived from petroleum.</p>
					<p>Many of these are products we use everyday... like shampoo, trash bags and detergents. So they also become more expensive.</p>
					<p>Electricity bills are also skyrocketing.</p>
					<p>Bills are so high that at least 20 million households are behind on their utility bills because they can't afford it.</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/74-Rising+Utility+Costs.png" alt="74" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>And this widespread inflation might be here to stay. According to Bank of America...</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/75-Bank+of+America.png" alt="75" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>That's why I'm recommending you buy a stock that I believe is a perfect hedge for this inflation.</p>
					<p>It's an investment that has been CRUSHING inflation for decades, and putting up a 2,590% return the past two decades... Unfortunately, most people don't know about it because most advertising for this company has been BANNED by the U.S. government.</p>
					<p>And that's a shame because this company has been <em>consistently </em><strong>increasing its payouts every single year, for 53 years in a row...</strong></p>
					<p>The 1987 stock market crash... the dot-com bust of 2000... the housing crash in 2008... the pandemic crash of 2020...</p>
					<p>None of those mattered.</p>
					<p>Payouts went UP, regardless of what was happening with the economy.</p>
					<p>That's why I put all of the details in another special report called <strong>The Perfect Stock for Biden's Inflation.</strong></p>
					<figure class="bonus-reports" style="margin-bottom: 1.4rem;"><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/76_A-The+Perfect+Stock+for+Biden’s+Inflation.png" alt="76_A" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>So how can you claim everything I've just mentioned?</p>
					<p>It's very simple.</p>
					<p>I've already made all these reports available to a small group of folks who follow my work.</p>
					<h2 class="subhead"><strong>Start Protecting and Potentially Profiting<br />From The Ideas in All My Reports In<br />The Next 5 Minutes</strong></h2>
					<p>You see, once they flip the switch on the digital dollar, I believe we'll see complete chaos not only in the markets but also in your way of life.</p>
					<p>So it's really not enough to give you all these special reports and wish you good luck.</p>
					<p>I'd like to stay in touch in the coming months so I can guide you every step of the way.</p>
					<p>That's why I'm inviting you to take a satisfaction guaranteed trial to my monthly newsletter called <strong>Moneyball's Sector Alpha Report.</strong></p>
					<p>When you do, I'll send you everything I've mentioned so far... 100% free.</p>
					<p>Like I mentioned before, some of the world's top hedge funds pay me a fortune to get my research.</p>
					<p>But I didn't think it was fair to make this information only available to the big dogs on Wall Street.</p>
					<p>So I decided to publish my research also for <span>folks</span> like you.</p>
					<p>So how does Moneyball's Sector Alpha Report work?</p>
					<p>It's simple.</p>
					<p>Each month, around the 15th of the month, I'll send you a new Sector Alpha report.</p>

					<p>Inside each issue, you'll also find what I call my "Moneyball Portfolio..."</p>
					<p>Where I keep track of all our open positions.</p>
					<p>Plus, anytime I find a new "special situation" opportunity<span>...</span></p>
					<p>I'll rush you a NEW special situation report packed with stock market moves to make, too.</p>
					<p>For example, once I uncovered this plan to implement the digital dollar...</p>
					<p>I wrote all the reports I mentioned to you today and sent them to members of Moneyball's Sector Alpha Report.</p>
					<p>So they already know how to opt out of Biden's evil plan.</p>

					<p>I will send you two other free bonus reports detailing how I've figured out how to harness various data sets to predict what will happen next in the markets.</p>
					<p>I call my system "Moneyball Economics," because it mimics the data-focused strategy used by Billy Beane in the famous movie Moneyball.</p>
					<p>So the first bonus report is called <strong><em>The Moneyball Trader's Playbook</em></strong></p>
					<div class="d-flex">

					<p>Membership to <strong>Moneyball's Sector Alpha Repor</strong>t normally has a published price of $299 for 12 months...</p>
					<p>Considering that some of the world's wealthiest hedge funds pay me a fortune to consult with them...</p>
					<p>That $299 annual fee is already a hell of a steal...</p>
					<p>But today you won't even have to pay that price.</p>
					<p>Given the urgency of this situation and the fact they're about to roll out this digital dollar plan...</p>
					<p>I was able to convince my publisher to give you a huge discount.</p>

					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/80-Bar+chart.png" alt="80" class="img-fluid" /></figure>

					<p>If you haven't figured it out by now, his name is Klaus Schwab and he's the founder and president of the World Economic Forum.</p>

					<p>Which is arguably the most influential platform in the world.</p>
					<p>As Economics professor Anthony Mueller, says, the mains purpose of the WEF is "global control"</p>
					<p>Fox Business described his organization as....</p>
					<figure><img src="https://cdn.moneyballeconomics.com/events/202302msa/83-FoxBusiness.png" alt="83" class="img-fluid" /></figure>
					<p>Like I showed you here today...</p>
					<p>He's using his connections to the most powerful people on the planet to implement an evil plan that will take complete control of your money and your life...</p>
					<p>All while enriching him and his friends.</p>
					<p>They already launched a pilot program.</p>
					<p>So we could be days away from them rolling it out across the nation.</p>
					<p>Since all the six big banks have already partnered with his organization, there's a very good chance your bank has already agreed to this.</p>
